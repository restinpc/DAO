# Community rules
This document contains the digital constitution of the DAO (principles and rules of the community).  
Compliance with these rules is actually the main requirement for the participants of the social graph.  
Violation of one or more points may be grounds for exclusion of a participant.  
These rules complement existing territorial rules, traditions, and norms, rather than replacing them.  
  
1) Equality in all possible relationships.  
2) Environmentally friendly behavior in all relationships.  
3) Zero level of mental burden.  
4) Intolerance towards material and energy parasitism.  
5) Focus on personal and societal development.  
6) Tolerance towards other beings and communities.  
7) Intolerance towards the use hard drugs and strong alcohol for fun.
